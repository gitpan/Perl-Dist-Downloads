NAME
    Perl::Dist::Downloads - The downloads required to build Vanilla Perl
    distros

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution has no servicable parts.

    It provides various zips and tarballs needed to build a Win32 Perl
    distribution.

    It is distributed separately so that the main Perl-Dist distribution
    (which will change far more often than the downloads) won't be bloated
    out to 25 meg.
